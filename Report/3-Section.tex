Analyzing using the software, we can infer that:
\begin{itemize}  
\item Runge-Kutta method has the highest performance (closest to exact solution, lowest local and global errors). Following is Improved Euler, and Euler method.
\item For $x_0=0.1$, $y_0=2$, $X=6.0$, from $N=20$, increasing $N$ does not significantly affect accuracy of Runge-Kutta method. This number for improved Euler method is around 150, and for Euler method is around 2000.
\end{itemize}
